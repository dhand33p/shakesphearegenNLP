### Shakespeare Generator

##Overview
This project is a web-based Shakepsspeare sonnet generator built on Flask, which allows users to input a prompt or starting line for the sonnet generation. The language model uses the prompt to generate the next few lines of the sonnet. Finally, the [Flask](https://generate-shakespearean-sonnets.dhand33p.repl.co/) application serves as the user interface, which displays the generated sonnet on the web page for the user to view. This project demonstrates how natural language processing and machine learning can be applied to creative writing and how Flask can be used to provide an easy-to-use interface for the user. Project is developed through AI Camp.
